## Compatibility
This only works on Windows XP and above. Currently, we only have AutoPlay executables for Windows 8.1, 10, and 11.
It works on one Linux distro we made called [the docs](/docs/README.md), which is actually the documentation and not a Linux distro.

## How to Use
### Step 1. Download and extract the `source` folder
The source folder contains all the executables and stuff, including the code for the crazy error itself.

### Step 2. Write the crazy error code inside `czesource.js`
This file is pulled to actually run. WARNING: don't write your code in `crazy.js`. Also don't copy and paste code into your `czesource.js`, as it has permission to run programs (even as administrator). For more information, [read the documentation](/docs/README.md)

### Step 3. Screenshot an autoplay dialog - if you're crazy error doesn't use any of the AutoPlay commands, you can skip to step 4.
Screenshot autoplay dialogs and save them to `autoplay.png` for Windows 11, `autoplay10.png` for Windows 10, and `autoplay81.png` for Windows 8.1. No need to do this for Windows 7 and XP, as the AutoPlay dialog can easily be recreated.

### Step 4. Run `crazy.exe`, close all other windows, and your crazy error will start in 5 seconds!
That's literally all there is to it.

## Not working?
### Step 1. Check the version
Do you have the write version?
### Step 2. Check your code
Is your code written correctly?
### Step 3. Check the folder
Is anything missing? Is an executable corrupted? Did you forget AutoPlay screenshots
### Step 4. Check [the docs](/docs/README.md)
you should read the docs to verify ;)
### Step 5. Submit an issue
cause why not
