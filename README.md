## Notice
This only works on Windows XP and above. Currently, we only have AutoPlay executables for Windows 8.1, 10, and 11.

## How to Use
### Step 1. Download and extract the `source` folder
The source folder contains all the executables and stuff, including the code for the crazy error itself.

### Step 2. Write the crazy error code inside `czesource.js`
This file is pulled to actually run. WARNING: don't write your code in `crazy.js`. Also don't copy and paste code into your `czesource.js`, as it has permission to run programs (even as administrator). For more information, [read the documentation](/docs/README.md)

### Step 3. Screenshot an autoplay dialog - if you're crazy error doesn't use any of the AutoPlay commands, you can skip to step 4.
Screenshot autoplay dialogs and save them to `autoplay.png` for Windows 11, `autoplay10.png` for Windows 10, and `autoplay81.png` for Windows 8.1. No need to do this for Windows 7 and XP, as the AutoPlay dialog can easily be recreated.

### Step 4. Run `crazy.exe`, close all other windows, and your crazy error will start in 5 seconds!
That's literally all there is to it.
